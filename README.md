# Health Management System

## Overview
This is a simple health management system implemented in Python. It allows users to store and manage their health-related information, such as personal details, daily activities (e.g., exercise and diet), and track calories burned. The system provides options to add users, add activities, view health reports, and update user information.

## Features
- **Add User**: Add a new user with personal details such as age, gender, height, and weight.
- **Add Activity**: Log daily activities (e.g., running, walking) along with the duration and calories burned.
- **View Health Report**: View a health report for a specific user, including activities and total calories burned.
- **Update User Info**: Update the user's age, height, or weight.
- **Exit**: Exit the system.

## Files
- **main.py**: Python script that contains the logic for adding users, adding activities, and viewing/updating reports.
- **README.md**: This file, which provides instructions for using the system.
